# Consul Template Example for HashiCorp Vault and Chef Integration
This project provides an example on how to integrate HashiCorp Vault with Chef using a Consul Template file.

## System Requirements
This project utilizes a local instance of Docker therefore you must have
Docker installed locally.

## Execute Converge
Because of the nature of how Vault is instantiated, this project has to be executed in a particular order and with multiple steps.

1. Run `bundle exec kitchen converge` in the [setup_stack](consul-template/modules/setup_stack) module first.
2. cat out the `tmp/vault_root_token.txt` file and save that in a variable `export TF_VAR_user_token=<root_token>`.
3. Run `bundle exec kitchen converge` in the [config_stack](consul-template/modules/config_stack) module next.
4. Export the Vault address `export VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200`
4. Get a user token with the new username/password created by the config_stack module
`vault login -method=userpass username=myusername` with `mypassword` as the password. Save off that token.
5. ssh into the client machine `ssh root@localhost -p 2222` with `root` as the password.
6. Export the token: `export VAULT_TOKEN=<user_token>` and run `consul-template -once -config=./consul_template_config.json`

### Under the hood
Here is what is going on when running the tests:

1. 3 containers are instantiated: `consul`, `vault`, `client`
2. `chef` is installed and `chef-solo` is configured on the `client`
3. The `client` container runs `berkshelf` to vendor the cookbooks necessary to install `consul-template`
4. The `client` is then authenticated to `vault` and `consul-template` renders a file locally with credentials

*NOTE: to reinitialize the vault, set CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR and run:
`consul kv delete -recurse vault`*
